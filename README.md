traceit
=======


traceit.js is a jQuery plugin based on raphael.js that allows you dynamically trace page elements.

Add a dynamic trace to any element on a page; configure its stroke width, animation speed, stroke/fill color and opacity as well as hideCallback, 
endTraceCallback and onClick callback functions.

Trace size adapts to contents.
